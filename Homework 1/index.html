								Hi, my name is Christopher Zalek. A lot of people call me <em>Zales</em>, and some of my weirder friends refer to me as <em>Zaletron</em>. It's a free country; express yourself.
					</p>
					<p>
						Looking back, it appears as though my career pivots every five to ten years. While some of these fields may seem discordant, I believe the common thread is my passion for creative problem solving within complex systems.

				<h3>Trajectory</h3>

								<br><span class="desc">I earned a Masters degree in Biomedical Illustration from UIC in 1994. Soon after graduation, I found myself in Richmond, VA creating demonstrative evidence for medical-legal court cases. Photoshop was just learning to walk, so I learned to use a real airbrush to illustrate an expert's testimony.</span>

								<a href="images/ui-design.png"><img class="about" src="images/ui-design.png" alt="MechAssault"></a>Senior UI Designer
								<br><span class="desc">Following a couple interactive and illustration gigs in Ames, IA and Akron, OH, I headed back to Chicago. I was hired to create the UI for an Xbox LIVE launch title named MechAssault. Working in the game development ecosystem was simultaneously exhilarting and exhaustive. Good times, epic fun.</span>

								<br><span class="desc">And then that thing happens: a chain of events leads to a large percentage of the staff being laid off. At this point in my life I was a bit more rooted. Since I was in a fairly tech-saavy town, I decided to start my company and try my hand at designing for web-based applications. It was a shaky start, but after four years, I feel as though I'm getting the hang of it.</span>

								<br><span class="desc">When AFK, I need to turn my mind off and ground out. Locally, I lead an ongoing tai chi practice in the Chicago community a few times each week. Big props also go to my wife Sara for reminding me to not sweat the big stuff, and that there is always more to see and explore in this big, big world of ours.</span>
